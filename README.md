# Quiz-yourself

The purpose of this Python module is to randomly select data science interview questions for
practice. Questions come from 7 categories; Communication, Data Analysis, Predictive Modeling,
Probability, Product Metrics, Programming, and Statistical Inference.

## Getting Started

Simply clone or download the folder to your local machine. 

## Running the module

To run the module, pass the path to the directory on your local machine and input the number of
questions (from each category) that you would like to be asked.

```
python ask_questions.py --dir=YOURDIR --num_questions=X
```

Additional categories can be easily added by supplying text files with questions separated by
a ';'.
