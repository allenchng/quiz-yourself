# Quiz-yourself

The purpose of this Python module is to randomly select data science interview questions for
practice. Questions come from 7 categories; Communication, Data Analysis, Predictive Modeling,
Probability, Product Metrics, Programming, and Statistical Inference.

## Getting Started

Simply clone or download the folder to your local machine. 

## Running the module

Run the module in command line. The only requirement to specify is the number of questions (from each category) you would like to be quizzed on. 

```
python ask_questions.py --num_questions=5
```

Additional categories can be easily added by supplying text files with questions separated by
a ';'.
