(Given a Dataset) Analyze this dataset and tell me what you can learn from it.;
What is R2? What are some other metrics that could be better than R2 and why?;
What is the curse of dimensionality?;
Is more data always better?;
What are advantages of plotting your data before performing analysis?;
How can you make sure that you don’t analyze something that ends up meaningless?;
What is the role of trial and error in data analysis? What is the the role of making a hypothesis before diving in?;
How can you determine which features are the most important in your model?;
How do you deal with some of your predictors being missing?;
You have several variables that are positively correlated with your response, and you think combining all of the variables could give you a good prediction of your response. However, you see that in the multiple linear regression, one of the weights on the predictors is negative. What could be the issue?;
Let’s say you’re given an unfeasible amount of predictors in a predictive modeling task. What are some ways to make the prediction more feasible?;
Now you have a feasible amount of predictors, but you’re fairly sure that you don’t need all of them. How would you perform feature selection on the dataset?;
Your linear regression didn’t run and communicates that there are an infinite number of best estimates for the regression coefficients. What could be wrong?;
You run your regression on different subsets of your data, and find that in each subset, the beta value for a certain variable varies wildly. What could be the issue here?;
What is the main idea behind ensemble learning? If I had many different models that predicted the same response variable, what might I want to do to incorporate all of the models?;
Given that you have wifi data in your office, how would you determine which rooms and areas are underutilized and overutilized?;
How could you use GPS data from a car to determine the quality of a driver?;
Given accelerometer, altitude, and fuel usage data from a car, how would you determine the optimum acceleration pattern to drive over hills?;
Given position data of NBA players in a season’s games, how would you evaluate a basketball player’s defensive ability?;
How would you quantify the influence of a Twitter user?;
like page rank with each user corresponding to the webpages and linking to the page equivalent to following.;
Given location data of golf balls in games, how would construct a model that can advise golfers where to aim?;
You have 100 mathletes and 100 math problems. Each mathlete gets to choose 10 problems to solve. Given data on who got what problem correct, how would you rank the problems in terms of difficulty?;
You have 5000 people that rank 10 sushis in terms of saltiness. How would you aggregate this data to estimate the true saltiness rank in each sushi?;
Given data on congressional bills and which congressional representatives co-sponsored the bills, how would you determine which other representatives are most similar to yours in voting behavior? How would you evaluate who is the most liberal? Most republican? Most bipartisan?;
How would you come up with an algorithm to detect plagiarism in online content?;
You have data on all purchases of customers at a grocery store. Describe to me how you would program an algorithm that would cluster the customers into groups. How would you determine the appropriate number of clusters to include?;
Let's say you're building the recommended music engine at Spotify to recommend people music based on past listening history. How would you approach this problem?;
How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?;
How would you go about doing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?;
How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset?;
Explain dimensionality reduction, where it’s used, and its benefits?;
What is data normalization and why do we need it?;
During analysis, how do you treat missing values?;
How would you deal with highly imbalanced response variables?;
